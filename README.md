# BeAllMySinsRemembered

## What is it?
You are working with people which like inheriting of anything from anything and
the `inherit` function occurs repeatedly in a project.

## How it can be useful for me?
You have probably no chance to explain to your colleagues that the inheritance
could be replaced by the composition (and this piece of code cannot help you
with your destiny), but it helps you to have the `inherit` function in a project
once time only.

## How it works?
Add it as a dependency into your project.

## What next?
If you have a problem, write me.
